        -Column                     -Property
        -Row or Record              -Instance

 - To work with LINQ to SQL first we need to convert all the relational objects of database
   into object oriented types and this process is known as ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
 - To perform ORM we are provided with a tool known as OR(Object-Relational) Designer.
 - Steps :
    - Step 1 : Perform ORM by adding OR Designer. 
    - Step 2 : Add a reference for an assembly i.e System.Data.Linq.dll.
    - Step 3 : We need to write the connection string into the Config file.
