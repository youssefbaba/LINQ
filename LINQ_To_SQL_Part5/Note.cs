 - We can use two syntax to write LINQ :
    - LINQ Query Operators:
        from <alias> in <array | coll | table> <[clauses]> select <alias> | new { <collist> };
    - LINQ Extension Method: more efficient.
 - Clauses : we need to respect this order mandatory.
    - Where
    - Group By
    - Order By
